\title{Test the coarsening at random (CAR) assumption}
\usage{
ei_test_car(spec, weights, iter = 1000, use_chisq = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{spec}{An \code{ei_spec} object created with \code{\link[=ei_spec]{ei_spec()}}. The object
should use the \code{preproc} argument to specify a rich basis expansion of the
covariates and predictors.}

\item{weights}{<\code{\link[rlang:args_data_masking]{data-masking}}> A vector of unit
weights for estimation. These may be the same or different from the total
number of observations in each aggregate unit (see the \code{total} argument to
\code{\link[=ei_spec]{ei_spec()}}). See the discussion below under 'Weights' for choosing this
parameter. The default, uniform weights, makes a slightly
stronger-than-necessary assumption about the relationship between the
unit totals and the unknown data.}

\item{iter}{The number of permutations to use when estimating the null
distribution. Ignored when \code{use_chisq = TRUE}.}

\item{use_chisq}{If \code{TRUE}, use the asymptotic chi-squared distribution for
the Wald test statistic instead of conducting a permutation test. Only
appropriate for larger sample sizes (Helwig 2022 recommends at least 200
when a single predictor is used).}
}
\value{
A tibble with one row per outcome variable and columns describing
the test results. The \code{p.value} column contains the p-values for the test.
P-values are not adjusted by default; pass them to \code{\link[stats:p.adjust]{stats::p.adjust()}} if
desired.
}
\description{
The CAR assumption, which is required for accurate estimates with \code{\link[=ei_est]{ei_est()}},
implies that the conditional expectation function (CEF) of the aggregate
outcomes will take a certain partially linear form. This function tests that
implication by comparing a fully nonparametric estimate of the CEF to one
in the partially linear form implied by CAR, and comparing their goodness-of-fit.
It is \strong{very important} that \code{preproc} be used in the \code{spec} to perform a
rich basis transformation of the covariates and predictors; a missing
\code{preproc} will lead to a warning.

\details{
The test is a Kennedy-Cade (1996) style permutation test on a Wald statistic
for the coefficients not included in the "reduced" model that would be fit
by \code{\link[=ei_ridge]{ei_ridge()}}.
The test is carried out by fitting a regression on a fully basis-expanded
combination of covariates and predictors, and calculating a Wald statistic
for the
