\title{Low-level implementations of \code{ei_ridge()} and \code{ei_riesz()}}
\usage{
ei_ridge_impl(x, y, z, weights, penalty = NULL)

ei_riesz_impl(x, z, total, weights, penalty)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix of predictors}

\item{y}{A vector of outcomes}

\item{z}{A matrix of covariates}

\item{weights}{A vector of estimation weights}

\item{penalty}{The ridge penalty (a non-negative scalar), which must be
specified for \code{\link[=ei_riesz_impl]{ei_riesz_impl()}} but can be automatically estimated with
\code{\link[=ei_ridge_impl]{ei_ridge_impl()}} by providing \code{penalty=NULL}.}

\item{total}{A vector of total observations per unit.}
}
\value{
A list with model components.
}
\description{
No checks are performed on the inputs.
Use of \code{\link[=ei_ridge]{ei_ridge()}} and \code{\link[=ei_riesz]{ei_riesz()}} is strongly recommended unless many
regressions must be fit, e.g., within a tight loop.
Only works for a single outcome, i.e., \code{y} must be a vector, not a matrix.
